~ C2_intro1
Leaving the castle meadows, Danny Pigrim had entered a dark space.
Harrowing shrieks flew past them, a storm of anguished cries...
"Lo," Virgil said, "hear the eternal screams of the condemned?"
"This is home of those who sin in Lust. Lovers eternal, eternal suffering."
"Oh well, at least they're not alone."
Just then, a figure began to emerge from the darkness...
It was a woman. She went up to Danny Pilgrim, who they learned was Francesca.
She told them of her present grief, past happiness, her joyous moments with her lover, Paolo...
Francesca's story moved Danny Pilgrim to their core, that pity took hold of them...
And brought Danny Pilgrim to faint and fall to Hell's floor.
Danny Pilgrim fell into a dark space of their own making.
"..."
Francesca scratched her head. "Um, is your friend okay?"

# this comes right after C2_intro1, now in the castle meadows
When Danny Pilgrim opened their eyes, they found themselves back at the castle meadows.
Was that a bad dream?
"Oh destined traveler, you have awakened!"
# SFX: DJ RECORD SCRATCH, show Virgil in his DJ outfit
Virgil stood before them, donning the garbs of the dance floor.
This must be a bad dream.
"You had fainted during Francesca's story," He said. "She was both flattered and concerned for your well-being."
"Perhaps you should consider getting a kale smoothie yourself."
Virgil waved his hand.
"But not now. For you have been tasked with an important honor..."
"The grand honor of serving this great banquet and dance party!"
Danny Pilgrim looked around and found countless pairs of people occupying the grassy meadows.
"These are the esteemed guests of Lust," Virgil said, "granted one day of reprieve from that pitiful darkness..."
"Oh, you don't remember signing up for this?"
Virgil smiled. "Silly goose, it was YOUR idea, was it not? You must've forgetten when you fainted."
"Anywho, these lusty pairs are willing to give anything for your products."
"So chop, chop, destined traveler."
"Or should I say, cha, cha?"
Danny Pilgrim stood before their next challenge.
This must be a bad dream.

Francesca: Danny Pilgrim, was it?
Francesca: I must give my deepest gratitude for your invitation to this wonderful reception.
Francesca: My dear Paolo, my friends, the other guests... they immensely enjoyed it all.
Francesca: To do all of this out of your own volition, you must love the work you do!
Francesca: Alas, we must return to that darkened void soon, but I will forever cherish this.
Francesca: Ah, please don't faint again.
Francesca: Otherwise, we'd have to get that lover of yours to carry you around again...
Francesca: Oh? You're not in a relationship with that man, Virgil?
Francesca: It's more of a business relationship? Oh I see, I have been mistaken.
Francesca: Danny, are you feeling well? You look gloomy all of the sudden...
Francesca: Workers' rights? Unfornately, I do not believe any of that exists in Hell...

	Virgil: Indeed, he is. It's a shame he despises me so much.

- Why are you here? /// Paolo
	Ovid: That is quite a broad question. From what I understand, many of us here did not believe in God.
	Ovid: But none of us have commited any vice in His eyes.
