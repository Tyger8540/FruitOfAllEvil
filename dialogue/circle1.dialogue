"...ABANDON EVERY HOPE, ALL YOU WHO ENTER."
"Oh, don't worry about that, destined traveler," Virgil said to Danny Pilgrim.
"They use that to scare away anyone with common sense," he continued, "it doesn't apply to us."
Suddenly, a booming voice came bellowing in front of them.
"Woe to you, perverted souls, who dare disregard this harrowing signâ€”"
An old man with white hair came by on a boat, floating on the River of Acheron.
"What's up, Charon," Virgil said.
The infernal boatman, Charon, groaned in disgust.
"Not this lunatic..."
Charon recomposed himself and grew fierce upon seeing Danny Pilgrim.
"You, living soul! You do not belong to the world of the dead. Return to whence you came!"
"Chill Charon," Virgil said, "this traveler here got a date with THE devil."
"Do not slander the name of Lucifer! None who is living shall pass through this river!"
Virgil grinned. "Not even if we pay a fee?"
"You see, this traveler here is on a journey to give Lucifer the greatest drink of all kind..."
"Don't you and your folks want a little sip?"
Charon and the tormented souls surrounding him looked at each other, a curiosity growing in their brows...

# intro text, when charon first appears on screen
Charon: Ho, living soul! I shall ignore your trespassing in exchange for your drink!
Charon: Do not disappoint these tormented souls.
Charon: And do not disappoint me.

Charon: You have earned the right to pass through.
Charon: Come aboard my boat, and I shall bring you across the river.
Charon: And regarding Virgil...
Charon: Let us hope you do not meet the same fates as the previous ones he brought over.

Virgil: Oh, how low can you go, destined traveler?
Virgil: Welcome to the First Circle of Hell, Limbo!
Virgil: Enjoy this nice reprieve in the castle meadows.
Virgil: The rest of Hell won't look this pretty.
# it would be interesting here if you could possibly change dialogue depending on whether
# the player had checked out Ovid's Stand FIRST.
Virgil: Enough talk, why don't you talk to the other vendor here?
Virgil: After you purchase something from me, of course.
# ALT DIALOGUE:
# Virgil: Oh, it seems you've already talked to the other vendor?
# Virgil: I hope you still have enough to purchase my wares as well.

- Charon was an interesting fellow.
	Virgil: Indeed, he is. It's a shame he despises me so much.
	Virgil: That's the price I pay for always going in and out of Hell...
	Virgil: Anyways, it's likely you'll encounter unfriendly characters like him.
	Virgil: Be prepared for any disturbances to your ways of fruit preparation.

- About the other ones you've guided...
	Virgil: Oh? Did Charon tell you about that?
	Virgil: Pay no mind to his hateful remarks.
	Virgil: Every human I've brought over is in good shape.
	Virgil: They're just toiling endlessly in Hell to repay their debts to me.

- Who do you work for?
	Virgil: I work with many clients.
	Virgil: ...
	Virgil: Not satisfied? Fine.
	Virgil: I currently work for Luciferâ€”to bring you over, of course.
	Virgil: Angels, devils, humans... I'm not picky, as long as you have what I want.

- Why are you here?
	Ovid: That is quite a broad question. From what I understand, many of us here did not believe in God.
	Ovid: But none of us have commited any vice in His eyes.
	Ovid: Thus, we are relegated to this quiet area for eternity...
	Ovid: I suppose we should be honored to have such a pleasant resting place.

- What were you doing before you died?
	Ovid: Hm... Forgive me, it has been such a long time.
	Ovid: I would like to believe I had been writing poetry...
	Ovid: Maybe something about tragic lovers, finding each other in death, in different forms...
	Ovid: Perhaps my works still exist somewhere on Earth...

- Have you met Virgil before?
	Ovid: Oh, the man who follows you around?
	Ovid: Hm... His face seems quite familiar...
	Ovid: He and I might've known each other, when we were both living on Earth.
	Ovid: But I suppose that's been a long time ago... We're complete strangers at this point.
